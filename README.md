Exploratory Data Analysis on US Air Pollution 

Introduction: When it comes to climate changes, air pollution is a topic that is mentioned but not really focused on because it isn't as tangible as other topics. With this project I wanted to explore air pollution by breaking it down into each pollutant: NO2, O3, SO2, and CO and learn how much each pollutant gets in our air.
